# Brints Estate - Backend

Brints Estate is a real estate website that allows users to search for properties, view property details, and contact the real estate agent. This is the backend service of the website that provides the API for the frontend to consume. The aim of this project is to learn how to build a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. Brints Estate Backend Service will bridge the gap for users to search for properties and process acquisition of the property in record time.
